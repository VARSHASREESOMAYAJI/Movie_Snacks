# 🔒 Security Measures - MovieSnacks Food Booking System

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented to ensure that regular users can NEVER access owner/admin functionality.

## 🚫 Access Control Layers

### 1. Template-Level Security
- **Owner links are completely hidden** from regular users in `base.html`
- **Conditional rendering**: `{% if user.is_authenticated and user.is_staff and user.is_superuser %}`
- **Multiple checks**: User must be authenticated, staff, AND superuser

### 2. View-Level Security
- **Decorator protection**: All owner views use `@login_required` and `@user_passes_test(is_owner)`
- **Function-level validation**: Additional security checks within each view
- **Permission verification**: `is_owner()` function checks multiple user attributes

### 3. User Permission Requirements
```python
def is_owner(user):
    return (user.is_authenticated and 
            user.is_active and 
            user.is_staff and 
            user.is_superuser)  # Only superusers can access owner features
```

**Requirements:**
- ✅ User must be authenticated (logged in)
- ✅ User must be active (not disabled)
- ✅ User must be staff member
- ✅ User must be superuser (highest privilege level)

### 4. URL Protection
- **All owner URLs** are protected by the same security decorators
- **No public access** to any owner endpoints
- **Automatic redirects** for unauthorized users

### 5. Security Logging
- **Unauthorized access attempts** are logged with user details
- **Security events** are tracked for monitoring
- **Audit trail** for compliance and security analysis

## 🛡️ Security Features

### What Regular Users CANNOT Do:
- ❌ See owner navigation links
- ❌ Access owner dashboard
- ❌ View order management
- ❌ Manage food items
- ❌ Access analytics
- ❌ Modify system settings
- ❌ View other customers' orders
- ❌ Access payment status information

### What Regular Users CAN Do:
- ✅ Browse food menu
- ✅ Add items to cart
- ✅ Place orders
- ✅ Select seats
- ✅ Choose payment methods
- ✅ View their own order confirmation

## 🔐 User Types & Access Levels

| User Type | Authentication | Staff | Superuser | Owner Access |
|-----------|----------------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Anonymous | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Regular User | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Staff User | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Superuser | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## 🚨 Security Best Practices

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Users only get access to what they absolutely need
- Owner functionality is completely isolated from customer functionality

### 2. Defense in Depth
- Multiple security layers (template, view, decorator, function)
- No single point of failure

### 3. Secure by Default
- Owner features are hidden by default
- Explicit permission grants required for access

### 4. Regular Security Audits
- Custom management command: `python manage.py test_security`
- Creates test users and verifies access control
- Ensures security measures are working correctly

## 📋 Security Checklist

- [x] Owner links hidden from regular users
- [x] All owner views protected with decorators
- [x] Multiple permission checks implemented
- [x] Unauthorized access logging enabled
- [x] Security testing command available
- [x] Documentation updated with security notes
- [x] README includes security warnings
- [x] Template-level access control implemented

## 🚀 Deployment Security

### Production Considerations:
1. **HTTPS Only**: Force SSL/TLS encryption
2. **Strong Passwords**: Enforce complex password policies
3. **Session Security**: Secure session configuration
4. **CSRF Protection**: Already enabled by Django
5. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing for login attempts
6. **Security Headers**: Add security headers in production

## 🔍 Testing Security

Run the security test command:
```bash
python manage.py test_security
```

This will:
- Create test users with different permission levels
- Test access to all owner views
- Verify that only superusers can access owner areas
- Report any security vulnerabilities

## 📞 Security Contact

If you discover any security issues:
1. **Do NOT** post them publicly
2. **Contact** the development team immediately
3. **Include** detailed reproduction steps
4. **Wait** for security assessment before disclosure

**Remember**: Security is everyone's responsibility. Regular users should never be able to see or access owner functionality!
